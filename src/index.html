        <h2>"WHY ARE THERE SO FEW WOMAN IN TECH?"</h2>
        <p>
            The main reason for the small number of women in technology is due to the lack of role-models for women within the sector and this is mainly down to the gender stereotype of ‘boys being better at science and maths’. Although in recent years there has been an increase in women entering high levels in technology roles, women are still in the minority compared to the number of male role models in the sector.

            <h2>INCREASING DEMAND FOR WOMEN IN IT</h2>
            <p>
                Only one-in-six of tech specialists in the UK are women, compared with 47% of the entire workforce, research from the Tech Partnership’s Women in IT scorecard reveals. Worse still, fewer than one-in-ten of these women are in leadership positions.
